# The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
the PRI's presidential candidate, on March 23, 1994, in the middle of a campaign gathering in Tijuana, shocked Mexico to its very core. In addition to being a tragic loss for Mexico, Colosio's assassination exposed a deep underbelly of corruption in the nation's political system. In this post: we go into the Colosio case, examining the claims of corruption that surrounded his campaign and the unanswered issues that continue to gnaw at everyone's collective memory in Mexico.

### Colosio's Vision for Change: 
 Luis Donaldo Colosio was an electrifying politician who sought to revolutionize Mexico's social and political landscape. He spoke vehemently about combating corruption inside the PRI, which had ruled Mexico for more than 70 years, as well as eradicating poverty and advancing human rights. Many Mexicans who desired for a more open and responsible government were moved by his promises of change.

### Allegations of corruption: 
 Colosio blasted the pervasive corruption inside the PRI throughout his campaign and pledged to take it on head-on. He sought to dismantle the established power structures and entrenched interests that were pervasive in Mexican politics. Due to his outspoken opposition to corruption, he posed a threat to those who benefited from the current system, which sparked rumors that influential individuals were behind his murder.

Colosio was shot at close range on that fatal day in Tijuana, and he passed away from his wounds later that evening. The assassination shook the country and sparked questions about a possible wider plot. Investigations suggested possible political motivations and that high-ranking PRI officials may have been involved, further inflaming public fury and suspicion.

## Unanswered Questions:
 Despite the official finding that the assassination was carried out by a lone shooter, there are still questions. Many people think that the assassination was the result of a well-planned scheme involving several participants rather than an accident. Numerous issues remain unanswered, adding to the general mistrust surrounding the case. A thorough investigation was not conducted, and testimony and evidence were withheld.
