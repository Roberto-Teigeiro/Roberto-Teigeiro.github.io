## We will explore the different types of corruption that exist in the world, how they impact society as a whole, and what preventive measures to take to avoid corruption.

### Types 

**Bribery:** It is the act of offering, delivering, or receiving money, gifts, favors, or other benefits in order to influence the behavior of a person in a position of power or authority.

**Nepotism:** It consists of granting jobs, contracts, or advantages to relatives or close friends instead of selecting the most qualified or suitable individuals for the position.

**Embezzlement:** It occurs when public or private funds intended for a specific purpose are diverted or misused for personal gain.

**Influence peddling:** It takes place when personal contacts or influences are used to obtain favors, privileges, or advantages in the business, political, or governmental spheres.

**Favoritism:** It involves granting preferential treatment or advantages to specific individuals or groups without valid justification or based on merit, thus discriminating against other individuals or entities.

**Extortion:** It involves obtaining money, goods, or favors through coercion, threats, or abuse of power. The extortionist uses their position to obtain benefits in exchange for not retaliating or carrying out harmful actions.

**Clientelism:** It refers to the exchange of political or economic benefits in exchange for electoral support. Politicians provide resources or services in exchange for the vote or loyalty of certain groups of voters.

**Electoral fraud:** It is the manipulation of electoral processes to influence the results, through the buying of votes, alteration of electoral records, ballot forgery, among other illicit methods.
