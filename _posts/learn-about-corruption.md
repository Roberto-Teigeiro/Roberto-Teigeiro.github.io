### What is corruption
Corruption refers to the misuse or abuse of entrusted power for personal or collective gain, involving practices such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, favoritism, or fraud, which undermine the principles of fairness, transparency, and integrity within a system or society. It is a pervasive problem that can erode public trust, hinder socio-economic development, and perpetuate inequality. Efforts to combat corruption involve promoting accountability, strengthening governance institutions, fostering transparency, and enforcing anti-corruption laws and measures.

### Causes

**Ambition and greed:** The pursuit of power, wealth, and personal benefits can lead some individuals to engage in corrupt acts. Unbridled ambition and greed are motivating factors for committing acts of corruption.

**Impunity and institutional weakness:** Impunity and the lack of effective consequences for acts of corruption undermine trust in institutions and can foster an environment conducive to corruption. If the institutions responsible for combating corruption are weak or compromised, corrupt individuals may feel protected.

**Lack of ethics and values:** The absence of a strong ethical culture and moral values can foster corruption. When individuals lack solid principles and a sense of social responsibility, they are more inclined to engage in corrupt practices.

**Low remuneration and lack of opportunities:** In some cases, corruption can be fueled by low salaries and a lack of economic opportunities. When public employees or officials do not receive adequate wages or do not have access to development opportunities, they may be more prone to accepting bribes or obtaining illicit gains.

**Lack of transparency and access to information:** Opacity in the management of public resources and the lack of access to information facilitate corruption. When accountability is limited and information is concealed, there are fewer chances of being discovered and sanctioned for corrupt acts.

### Consecuences

**Deterioration of trust and legitimacy:** Corruption undermines the trust of citizens in institutions and the political system. When public officials engage in corrupt acts, the legitimacy of institutions is undermined, creating an atmosphere of mistrust that can negatively affect a country's stability and development.

**Obstructed economic development:** Corruption hinders sustainable economic growth. Corrupt acts divert public resources that could be allocated to infrastructure, basic services, education, or healthcare. Additionally, corruption discourages foreign investment and undermines business activity, which negatively impacts the overall economy.

**Exacerbated inequality and poverty:** Corruption offenses often lead to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Resources meant for social welfare programs and poverty reduction are illegally diverted, perpetuating inequality and hindering access to basic services and opportunities for those most in need.

**Weakening of justice and the rule of law:** Corruption has a negative impact on the justice system and the rule of law. Corruption offenses can influence judicial independence, hinder investigations, and manipulate the legal system for personal gain. This creates an atmosphere of impunity, undermines trust in justice, and weakens the protection of rights and equality before the law.

**Harmful social and moral effects:** Corruption has detrimental social and moral effects on a society. It fosters dishonesty, promotes a culture of bribery, and undermines ethical values. Furthermore, corruption can generate social discontent, increase polarization, and lead to social tensions that can trigger protests and conflicts.
