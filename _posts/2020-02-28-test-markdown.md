### What is corruption
Corruption refers to the misuse or abuse of entrusted power for personal or collective gain, involving practices such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, favoritism, or fraud, which undermine the principles of fairness, transparency, and integrity within a system or society. It is a pervasive problem that can erode public trust, hinder socio-economic development, and perpetuate inequality. Efforts to combat corruption involve promoting accountability, strengthening governance institutions, fostering transparency, and enforcing anti-corruption laws and measures.

### Causes

**Lack of Transparency:** When there is a lack of transparency in government processes and decision-making, it creates an environment conducive to corruption. Without transparency, it becomes easier for officials to engage in corrupt practices without being held accountable.


~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
